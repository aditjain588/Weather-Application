# Weather Application </br>
Weather application can be used to get a real time weather information of a location </br>
</br>
This app uses WeatherStack API to convert a city name to its corresponsing latitude and longitude and also uses Mapbox API to get live weather infromation about a place using its latitude and longitude. </br>

A user can inputs a city name and he gets the corresponding temperature, wind speed, humidity of that place. </br>

Currently working on adding a way to get weather using current location of an user.
